# 🔌 raufier

## 🙋 What is raufier?

Raufier stands for ``REST API UI -(i)fier`` which describes the purpose of this application. You can test your web REST APIs in a graphical manner. This tool can also be used for documentation purposes. Keep in mind that I created this application for one of my own projects, but I've **open sourced** it so other people can use it freely or build upon it.

If you build upon this project (fork it, modify it and/or redistribute it) please credit my github page [github.com/francisstudios](https://github.com/francisstudios)
